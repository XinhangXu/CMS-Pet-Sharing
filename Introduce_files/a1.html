  <h1>CP3402 - Assignment 1 - Startup</h1>
  <p><strong>Xinhang Xu</strong></p>
  <h2>Goal/s</h2>
  <p>Briefly and clearly describe the measurable goal/s of your website here.</p>
  <p><b>This website is supposed to be a platform for whom would like to rent pets. Sharing pets is a setup bussiness built by Xinhang Xu (13757132). 
    On the website, it will introduce the function of sharing pets platform briefly. 
    Our goal is introducing and providing rental pets service. Users can rent pets for a short period by searching relevant pets information on our platform. 
    The website is consisted of three main parts which are abstract introduction, rental pets and pets care respectively. 
    The pages built by WordPress and Joomla, both of them include introduction page, rental pets information page, pet care service page and contact page. 
  </b></p>
  <h2>Links</h2>
  <p>Add URLs (and modify CMS names if you've used different CMSs).</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>WordPress site: <a href="https://a1-petsharing-wp.xinhangx.sgedu.site/" target="_blank">This site built by WordPress -> https://a1-petsharing-wp.xinhangx.sgedu.site/</a></b></li>
    <li><b>Joomla site: <a href="https://a1-petsharing-jml.xinhangx.sgedu.site/" target="_blank">This site built by Joomla ->  https://a1-petsharing-jml.xinhangx.sgedu.site/</a></b></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Plugins</h2>
  <p>List what plugins you used with their URLs and a very brief description of what you used them for.<br> It should be obvious from 
    this how/where they are used on your site.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>WordPress site: Elementor Page Builder - <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/" target="_blank">Elementor Page Builder</a> - This is a very useful plugin of 
    WordPress, I use it nearly everywhere on my site. Thanks to Elementor Page Builder, it allows me to modify the module directly. Design becomes easier 
    and visualable by useing it.</b></li>
    <li><b>WordPress site: Duplicator - WordPress Migration Plugin - <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/" target="_blank">Duplicator - WordPress Migration Plugin</a> - 
      Duplicator is a useful plugin of migration, especially for who develop sites on WordPress localhost. By using Duplicator, developers will not migrate files
     to live host manully. I use it on migrating my sites from localhost to siteground.</b></li>
    <li><b>Joomla site: ARK Editor - <a href="https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/jck-editor/" target="_blank">- Joomla site: ARK Editor</a> ARK Editor is a useful Joomla plugin which simplify the process of creation
     for developers. It allows users to editor page elements directly without the need to use another editing screen. I used it to build layout.</b></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Reflection and Insights</h2>
  <p>Describe your experience using the two different CMSs.<br> What have you learned through this assignment regarding the different systems?<br /> 
    This should be thoughtful and to-the-point; not a complete review of the two different systems, but your
    lessons learned.</p>

    <p><b>In terms of what I learned from finishing this assignment, I knew more of WordPress and Joomla, especially WordPress. By finishing assignment using this CMS, 
      I search a large amount of tutorials of WordPress. How to install it, how to build sites by it, how to migrate from localhost to live site. WordPress is really a 
      user-friendly instrument to build sites. With regards to Joomla, personally, it is a little bit worse than WordPress. The operate interface is 
      not as clear as in WordPress. And WordPress is more convenient than Joomla, because there are many useful plugins and themes could be downloaded directly 
      in WordPress. However, users have to search online for Joomla extensions, then install into Joomla. And most of Joomla templates are not free. In case of 
      free temples, there are a lot elements supposed to be built by users. Finally, I also learned how to manage live site by using siteground. There are some problems
      when using siteground. I created subdomain for this assignment, at first it shew 404 after creating subdomain which made me so sad. Then I searched online to solve 
      this problem. I learned a lot. In conclusion, both of Joomla and WordPress are welcomed CMSs, however, in my point of view, WordPress is better.
