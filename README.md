# CMS-Pet-Sharing

# Target
Design, create and publish a website for your own startup idea using two different well-known CMSs.
“A startup is a company working to solve a problem where the solution is not obvious and success is not guaranteed” says Neil Blumenthal, cofounder and co-CEO of Warby Parker.
Wikipedia says a startup is an entrepreneurial venture or a new business designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model. It is not just a new business... So, your idea must have some innovative and novel aspect to it. Examples of business ideas that are NOT startups include: online clothing store, hair dressing salon, IT consultancy, website design company, restaurant… Those are all “tried and true” or “normal” businesses where the solution is obvious, and are therefore not suitable for your assignment topic.



# Design
The two sites should have the same content and structure but do not need to be identical. They should look as similar as practical, but you do not need to create custom themes/templates. You can use any available designs, but they should be appropriate for your goal and target audience.


# Introduce of My Design --- Pet Sharing

(1) Goals


This website is supposed to be a platform for whom would like to rent pets. Sharing pets is a setup bussiness built by Xinhang Xu (13757132). On the website, it will introduce the function of sharing pets platform briefly. Our goal is introducing and providing rental pets service. Users can rent pets for a short period by searching relevant pets information on our platform. The website is consisted of three main parts which are abstract introduction, rental pets and pets care respectively. The pages built by WordPress and Joomla, both of them include introduction page, rental pets information page, pet care service page and contact page.


(2) Plugins


WordPress site: Elementor Page Builder - Elementor Page Builder - This is a very useful plugin of WordPress, I use it nearly everywhere on my site. Thanks to Elementor Page Builder, it allows me to modify the module directly. Design becomes easier and visualable by useing it.


WordPress site: Duplicator - WordPress Migration Plugin - Duplicator - WordPress Migration Plugin - Duplicator is a useful plugin of migration, especially for who develop sites on WordPress localhost. By using Duplicator, developers will not migrate files to live host manully. I use it on migrating my sites from localhost to siteground.


Joomla site: ARK Editor - - Joomla site: ARK Editor ARK Editor is a useful Joomla plugin which simplify the process of creation for developers. It allows users to editor page elements directly without the need to use another editing screen. I used it to build layout.


(3) Reflection and Insights


In terms of what I learned from finishing this assignment, I knew more of WordPress and Joomla, especially WordPress. By finishing assignment using this CMS, I search a large amount of tutorials of WordPress. How to install it, how to build sites by it, how to migrate from localhost to live site. WordPress is really a user-friendly instrument to build sites. With regards to Joomla, personally, it is a little bit worse than WordPress. The operate interface is not as clear as in WordPress. And WordPress is more convenient than Joomla, because there are many useful plugins and themes could be downloaded directly in WordPress. However, users have to search online for Joomla extensions, then install into Joomla. And most of Joomla templates are not free. In case of free temples, there are a lot elements supposed to be built by users. Finally, I also learned how to manage live site by using siteground. There are some problems when using siteground. I created subdomain for this assignment, at first it shew 404 after creating subdomain which made me so sad. Then I searched online to solve this problem. I learned a lot. In conclusion, both of Joomla and WordPress are welcomed CMSs, however, in my point of view, WordPress is better.
